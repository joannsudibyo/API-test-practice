# API Testing with Cypress
### This repository contains API test cases using Cypress for the Rest API available at https://fakerestapi.azurewebsites.net/index.html.

# Notes (Please read)
### - The Fakerest API is used for testing purposes, and the data is static.
### - Due to the nature of the Fakerest API, modifications or deletions won't persist.
### - Make sure to adapt the tests or extend them based on your specific use cases.
### - Most of the tests are similar despite that they are divided in 5 different folders (you can just check Activities and Books test folders)
